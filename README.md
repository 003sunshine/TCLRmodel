Tree-Classifier for Linear Regression (TCLR) is a novel Machine learning model to capture the functional relationships between features and a target based on correlation.

Written using Python, which is suitable for operating systems, e.g., Windows/Linux/MAC OS etc.

## Installing TCLR
+ pip install TCLR

## Running TCLR

+ from TCLR import TCLRalgorithm as model
+ dataSet = "testdata.csv" # dataset name
+ correlation = 'PearsonR(+)'
+ minsize, threshold, mininc = 3, 0.9, 0.01
+ model.start(dataSet, correlation, minsize, threshold, mininc, gplearn = True)


TCLR Version 1 is coded by Paython language, thus the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of Python is essential. TCLR can be executed through any python IDE


**graphviz** package is needed for running TCLR, which can be downloaded from the official website http://www.graphviz.org/. see user guide

Output:

+ a folder called 'Segmented' for saving the subdataset of each leaf (passed test)
