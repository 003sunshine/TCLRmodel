Develpment by Python 3.7, which can be run on operating systems such as Windows/Linux/MAC OS etc.

## Running TCLR

TCLR.V1.0.0 is coded by Paython language, thus the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of Python is essential. TCLR can be executed directly through the python IDE, or used by download the Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) we provided： TCLR.exe

**graphviz** package is needed for running TCLR, which can be downloaded from the official website http://www.graphviz.org/.

Output: 
data classification structure tree in pdf format（Result of TCLR.pdf)

## PredictGUI:
We provide an executable interface that predicts oxidation weight gain.
There is a built-in system folder (resource), please do not delete!


The GUI can be  download at Releases ——> TCLR_upload_files
